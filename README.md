### About me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Before joining Prof. Li Zhang's group in 2016, I earned M.Sc. in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I received my B.Eng. in Mechatronics from Hefei University of Technology (HFUT) in 2015.

My reseach is focusing on the micro-/nano-robotics field, related topics including the collectie behaviors of micro/nanorobots, real-time control and navigation of magnetic swarming micro/nanorobotsï¼Œand dynamic self-assembly. I am also interested in the integration of swarming micro/nanorobots with medical imaging system for preclinical biomedical applications.
